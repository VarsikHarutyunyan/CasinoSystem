CasinoSystem Overview:
The CasinoSystem is a .NET 6 Web API that manages a casino's operations, including user management,
 bonuses, and roles. It uses a repository pattern for structured data access and Entity Framework Core as an ORM for database interactions.

Technologies Used:
.NET 6: Framework for building APIs
Swagger: For API documentation and testing
Entity Framework Core: Code-first approach for database management
Identity Framework: Handles user authentication, authorization, and roles
Repository Pattern: Separates data access logic from the business logic
Swagger Documentation:
The Swagger interface provides a user-friendly UI for interacting with the API endpoints. Detailed descriptions of each endpoint, their inputs, and expected outputs are included. Users can test endpoints directly from the Swagger UI.

Repository Pattern:
The application follows the repository pattern, consisting of multiple layers:

HTTP Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests through API controllers.
API Controller Layer: Receives requests, passes them to the service layer, and returns responses.
Service Layer: Contains business logic, performs validations, and interacts with the repository.
Repository Layer: Communicates with the database using Entity Framework Core to perform CRUD operations on user data, bonuses, and roles.
Database Schema:
The database structure includes tables/entities for users, roles, bonuses, and their relationships,
 managed by Entity Framework Core's code-first approach. Identity Framework manages user authentication, authorization, and role-based access.

Testing the API:
Access the Swagger UI at /swagger.
Utilize the interactive UI to test each endpoint by providing necessary input parameters and observing the responses.
Verify the functionality by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information, bonuses, and roles.
This documentation aims to provide an overview of the CasinoSystem's functionalities, 
architectural design, and the technologies employed, ensuring clarity on how to interact with the API and its capabilities.
 You may further expand it to include more detailed descriptions of endpoints, request/response examples, and specific use-case scenarios.
